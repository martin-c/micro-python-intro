# Micro Pyhton
A project by [Damien George](http://dpgeorge.net/)
Project site: http://micropython.org/

Project was funded by a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/214379695/micro-python-python-for-microcontrollers) in December 2013. There are at least 6,000 Micro Python board out there at this point.

## Project Goals
**Micro Python** is a lean and fast implementation of the Python 3 programming language that is optimised to run on a microcontroller. The **Micro Python board** is a small electronic circuit board that runs Micro Python on the bare metal, and gives you a low-level Python operating system that can be used to control all kinds of electronic projects.

The project is not meant to be a CPython replacement. It is meant to be a Python implementation which is an order of magnnitude smaller than CPyhton to permit it to be used where CPython cannot be used at all. Micro Python is a CPython subset.
* The theorhetical minimum hardware requirements: 128K ROM/8K RAM.
* A unix port for devices with very constrained flash memory, such as a router with 4MB of total flash.
* Comparable is size to embedded Lua.

>If Micro Python could run Django, even in some heavily stripped down form, then that would get people's attention. Imagine nginx + uPy :) Thanks to pfalcon, Micro Python can already act as a simple web server or client. With generator support, it can almost start to be a real server.

## Micro Python Interpreter
Micro Python implements the entire Python 3.4 syntax (including exceptions, "with", "yield from", etc.). The following core datatypes are provided:
* str (partial Unicode support)
* bytes
* bytearray
* tuple
* list
* dict
* set
* array.array
* collections.namedtuple
* yield from http://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=85
* classes and instances
Builtin modules include sys, time, and struct. Note that only subset of Python 3.4 functionality implemented for the data types and modules.

## Micro Python Board
The Micro Python board (pyboard) is a small microcontroller board that runs Micro Python. It is based on the STM32F405RGT6 MCU and includes USB, a micro SD card slot and an accelerometer.

STM32F405RGT6 Stats:
* ARM Cortex-M4 32bit MCU+FPU, 210DMIPS
* 168 MHz
* 1M Flash
* 192K SRAM
* 10 hardware timers, RTC, Random number generator, 3x I2C/SPI, 4 USARTS, USB, 2x CAN, 12b ADC, 12b DAC
* Running power consumption at 3.3V:
  * 87 mA with all peripherals enabled at 168 MHz
  * 20 mA with all peripherals disabled at 90MHz
  * 5 mA with all peripherals disabled at 16MHz
  * 1 mA with in sleep mode at 8MHz
